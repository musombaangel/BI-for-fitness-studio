# BI for Fitness Center
This project focuses on analyzing the operations of a fitness centre in Nairobi, assessing their Business Intelligence maturity using Gartner's model, integrating a business intelligence solution and providing the business with relevant operational recommendations.

## Project Background
Data analytics is growing and enabling businesses in all sectors to be more efficient and provide tailored services that resonate with individual needs and preferences. The fitness industry has been left behind, but is now starting to digitize and integrate software into operations such as member management and scheduling.<br><br>
Our project aims to leverage a business intelligence solution that would enable Home of Sweat to achieve and monitor both short-term and long-term goals. Through analytics and data driven decision making, the gym can maximize income, meet customer preferences and ensure operational efficiency.<br>

## Assessment Results
The assessment our team conducted of the studio yielded that there were gaps in the following areas:
* Data collection:  The amount of data collected is minimal, and does not aid current processes. For example, attendance records which only contain customers’ first names.
* Data collection process: Data collection is manual, leading to unnecessary repetition and unavailability of data beyond a certain point.
* Data storage: Data is stored in books kept in cabinets. This is an insecure way to store personal information such as members’ records and financial documents
* Data analysis: There is no framework currently available for data analysis, limiting data-driven decision making. Decisions are often made based on staff and management supervision and have limited data driving it.
* Reporting: Reports are manual and are made available only when requested.
* Packages: Packages are not officially documented and there is no analysis on their popularity. The staff are often unaware of what packages various customers are on, leading to issues with tracking and management.
* Decision support: There is no existing framework for data-driven decision support and decisions are usually based on staff oversight.

## The Solution
* Spreadsheets for data entry and collection: With the goal of later expanding to a dedicated system, spreadsheets are utilized in this project to collect data. They were chosen for their familiar interface to non-technical staff. This ensures availability, greater storage space and cost-saving on stationary.
* Data analysis and visualizations: The BI dashboards allow for data analysis and visualization to provide insights on various sectors such as packages.
* Automated reporting: The interactive dashboards allow for reports to be available at all times, provided the data is updated.
* Decision support: Using the visuals available on the report, the management is able to make data-informed decisions.
