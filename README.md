# **Business Intelligence (BI) Solution for Fitness Center**
## **Project Overview**
This project focuses on implementing a Business Intelligence (BI) solution for a growing gym and business centre in Nairobi, Kenya that previously relied on paper-based data management. The BI system aims to streamline operations, enhance data-driven decision-making, and optimize financial performance.

## **Industry Overview**
The fitness industry is evolving with data-driven strategies to improve customer engagement and operational efficiency. Many small and medium-sized gyms still rely on manual data tracking, limiting their ability to analyze trends, manage memberships, and maximize revenue.

## **Selection of SME**
Home of Sweats was selected due to its growth potential and operational challenges. The gym collects data manually, lacks structured membership packages, and attracts a mix of fitness enthusiasts and professional dancers. A BI solution will help the gym standardize pricing, track performance, and improve customer retention.

## **Project Scope**
The BI solution includes data collection, analysis, and visualization of key business metrics such as membership trends, attendance rates, revenue tracking, and energy consumption. The system is designed to scale with the gym’s expansion.

## **Methodology**
- **Staff & Management Interviews** – Gathered insights on business operations, pain points, and data tracking challenges.
- **Data Collection** – Retrieved historical receipts, attendance records, and membership details for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Cleaned, processed, and visualized data to uncover trends and inefficiencies.

## Assessment Results
The assessment our team conducted of the studio yielded that there were gaps in the following areas:
* Data collection:  The amount of data collected is minimal, and does not aid current processes. For example, attendance records which only contain customers’ first names.
* Data collection process: Data collection is manual, leading to unnecessary repetition and unavailability of data beyond a certain point.
* Data storage: Data is stored in books kept in cabinets. This is an insecure way to store personal information such as members’ records and financial documents
* Data analysis: There is no framework currently available for data analysis, limiting data-driven decision making. Decisions are often made based on staff and management supervision and have limited data driving it.
* Reporting: Reports are manual and are made available only when requested.
* Packages: Packages are not officially documented and there is no analysis on their popularity. The staff are often unaware of what packages various customers are on, leading to issues with tracking and management.
* Decision support: There is no existing framework for data-driven decision support and decisions are usually based on staff oversight.

## **Relevant Data Sources**
- **Receipts & Payment Records** – To analyze revenue streams and payment trends.
- **Attendance Records & Schedules** – To track gym usage patterns and peak hours.
- **Membership Packages** – To assess package popularity and customer retention rates.
- **Electricity Consumption Data** – To monitor operational costs and efficiency.


## Missing data
Data was scarce and incomplete, therefore some was simulated to demonstrate to the business what insights they would be able to harvest if they collected the missing data. The simulated data included:
- Income data
- Package membership<br>
This data was integrated with existing data and formed the packages and income vs expenses dashboards.

## **Chosen BI Tools & Technologies**
- **Power BI** – Used for data visualization, interactive dashboards, and trend analysis.
- **Excel** – For initial data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analytics. Chosen because it is familiar to staff.

## **Dashboard Features & Functionality**
### **Attendance Analysis**
Tracks active members, visualizes daily attendance patterns, determines retention rates and identifies members that have left for contact purposes.
Enables attendance tracking scheduling optimizations based on attedance patterns and follow up/ outreach to leaving clients. 

### **Expenses analysis**
Monitors and breaks down gym expenses.
Enables cost monitoring and informs financial decision making.

### **Electricity Consumption Tracking**
Monitors energy usage, identifying high-cost periods and efficiency opportunities.
Enables tracking and management of electricity use and/or wastage.

### **Packages Performance Monitoring**
Breaks down package popularity and performance.
Enables optimization of packages.

Package details are as follows.
`Package 0`: Walk-ins. Clients in this category are not subscribed to any package and pay a flat fee of Ksh 1000 on a walk-in bases.<br>
`Package 1`: Ksh 3000 paid weekly for 4 sessions.<br>
`Package 2`: Ksh 4500 paid bi-weekly for 3 sessions a week.<br>
`Package 3`: Ksh 10,000 paid monthly for 5 sessions a week.<br>
`Package 4`: Ksh 4,000 paid weely for 5 sessions.<br>

## **Findings**
### Package Performance
- There is overreliance on walk-in sessions, which is unreliable because walk-in clients are not members.
- Package 4 performs the best out of all the packages offered.
- Package 3 is also quite popular.
- Package 1 and 2 are the most unpopular packages.

## **Future Growth and Scalability Plans**
- Implementation of a dedicated system for data entry and storage.
- Implementation of a Business Intelligence Competence Center with technical professionals.
- Increased collection of data.
- Use of BI for predictive analysis.

## **Challenges Faced**
- **Data Inconsistencies** – Historical records were incomplete and manually recorded; requiring transcription and significant cleaning.
- **Limited Technical Expertise** – Staff needed training to effectively use the BI dashboard.
- **Resistance to Change** – Some employees were hesitant to shift from traditional record-keeping methods.
- **Integration Difficulties** – Aligning existing business processes with new data-driven approaches took time.
- **Electricity Monitoring Challenges** – Gathering reliable electricity usage data was difficult due to lack of existing tracking systems.

## **Conclusion**
Implementing a BI solution for Home of Sweats provided actionable insights that enhanced operational efficiency, improved revenue tracking, and optimized resource allocation. The dashboard empowers management with real-time analytics, positioning the gym for sustainable growth.
